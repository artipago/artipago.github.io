### Postdoc in Computational Neuroscience

We are looking for a post-doc to work with us at the Centre de Recherche de Cerveau et Cognition (CerCo) in Toulouse, France. The project will be led by Andrea Alamia and funded by the European Research Council (ERC). <br> 
<br> 
<ins>Work environment</ins> <br> 
The successful applicant will join the Centre de Recherche de Cerveau et Cognition (CerCo) in a lively research institute in Toulouse, a thriving Southern France city. CerCo is a research center created by the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and the University Paul Sabatier, composed of over 30 research scientists and around 40 doctoral and post-doctoral students. The applicant will join the NeuroAI team, with a strong focus on computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence. The team has access to different experimental facilities, such as EEG, TMS, and fMRI, as well as computational resources (clusters and local GPUs). <br> 
<br> 
<ins>The project</ins> <br> 
The project is part of an ERC starting grant investigating the role of oscillatory traveling waves in cognitive functions. Our primary goal is to study neural oscillations within and between cortical regions, as well as cortical-thalamic interactions. Our approach's novelty consists of framing the model in the light of Predictive Coding principles, using a computational approach based on spiking and deep neural networks. We'll compare the results of the simulations against experimental recordings of human participants (mostly EEG) to validate and assess the model's predictions.<br> 
<br> 
<ins>Requirements</ins> <br> 
•	Applicants should hold a PhD in computational neuroscience, computer science, engineering, cognitive science, or similar. <br> 
•	Ability to work independently, developing ideas and interests within the project's scope. <br> 
•	A solid mathematical background and excellent computing skills, including programming (e.g., MATLAB, Python). Experience with system theory, models of cortical circuits, and knowledge of neural oscillations are not strictly necessary but highly appreciated.
•	Fluent in English in both speaking and writing. Knowledge of French is not required. <br> 
<br> 
The position will run for one year and is renewable for up to 3 years; its starting date is flexible (between March and October 2023). 
Salary depends on experience and will be determined following CNRS guidelines. <br> 
<br> 
To apply, please send a CV, including the name of two potential references, and a summary of research interests to Andrea Alamia (andrea.alamia at cnrs.fr). Review of applications will remain ongoing until the position is filled. <br>
