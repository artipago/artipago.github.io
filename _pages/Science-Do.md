### Science-Do

In Japanese, the word ‘do’ means quite literally ‘way’, in the sense of ‘way of doing things’ or ‘philosophy’ (like in JuDo, ‘the way of Gentleness’). Here I try to summarize my Science-do, or my way of thinking Science. <br> 
<br> 
**Learning.** Studying new topics is the main drive and motivation for doing Science. Exploring new concepts and reading about new ideas and theories is vital for being not only a good scientist but a better human being. The more we know, the better we are. Quoting Bruce Lee: ‘All type of knowledge eventually means self-knowledge’.  <br> 
<br> 
**Building bridges.** Applying ideas from one field to another is what makes Science exciting. Interdisciplinarity is not just a fancy word for grant application but an effective way of thinking. Digging deep into one topic and becoming an expert in that field is essential, but we should never forget to keep an open mind. <br> 
<br> 
**Cooperation over competition.** I do my best to share my code, data, and ideas. I try not to be shy and to talk and discuss my scientific opinions with everyone, to thoroughly analyze my thoughts and convictions to change and improve them at any time. Learning from others as much as possible, and in turn, try to share my expertise (if any!). To do this, it helps to keep in mind that papers are the results of our work, not our goal. <br> 
<br> 
**It’s a journey, dare and have fun.** Often we fail big time, sometimes we tremendously succeed. Success sets the stones of our career, failure teaches us some valuable lessons. Like in the poem of Constantine Cavafy, I try not to be afraid of setting out for my Ithaca, knowing that eventually the ultimate prize is each moment of the journey itself.<br>
