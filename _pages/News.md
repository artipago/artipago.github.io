Below some news about the team! <br> 

### 20th of May 2025 - Presentation at Pint of Science
It's again <a href="https://pintofscience.fr/events/toulouse/">Pint Of Science</a> time! Antoine Grimaldi gave a very clear and interesting presentation about perception, visual illusion and hallucinations. With very clear (and funny) examples, Antoine explained how his work on belief propagation and circular inference explores hallucinations and perception in healthy humans as well as in schizophrenia. A big thank to the <a href="https://www.univ-tlse3.fr/vie-associative-universitaire/brainbow/">Brainbow</a> association for the organization! <br>

### Semaine du Cerveau
Thanks to the organizers of the 'Brain's awareness week' for letting Benedikt Zoefel and Andrea Alamia presenting (in French!) about brain oscillations to the general public. It was quite exciting to carry out this event at the main library in Toulouse. After some theoretical introduction, participants could try and visualize their own brain waves with a protable EEG system. Looking forward to next year event! <br>

### Featured paper in Journal of Neuroscience with Yifan Zeng and Paul Sauseng
The great work of Yifan Zeng, in collaboration with Paul Sauseng, was selected as a <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/44/50/e0532242024"> featured article</a>  in the Journal of Neuroscience. In this work, we investigated the relationship between traveling waves and visual working memory, disentangling the role of forward and backward alpha-waves. Learn more about it <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/44/50/e0532242024"> here</a>. <br> 
<br> 

### Oscillatory brain waves workshop in Lausanne
It was great to attend and present at the <a href="https://brain-waves-workshop.github.io/2024/"> oscillatory brain waves</a>  workshop in Lausanne, organized by David Pascucci and Maria Rigoni. The workshop was a great occasion to catch up on fantastic work from early career researcher. Looking forward for the second edition! <br> 
<br> 


### Traveling waves workshop
Very excited to have host the second traveling waves workshop in Toulouse. We were so proud to have as speakers Laura Dugué and Kirsten Petras (Université Cité Paris), Frederic Chavane (INT, Marseille), Matteo di Volo (Univeristé de Lyon), Mehdi Senoussi (CLLE, Toulouse), Gregor Thut (CerCo, Toulouse) and our team members Martina, Jakob and Andrea (CerCo, Toulouse). The workshop was enriched by two roundtable sessions about 'growing up in Science' and 'managing a research group'.  <br>  <img src="/assets/images/workshopWavesCut.png" width="400" height="400"> 
<br> 

### ¡Jakob's new preprint is out!
We are excited to present the latest <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.15.623743v1.full.pdf">work</a> from Jakob: "a hierarchical multiscale model of forward and backward alpha-band traveling waves in the visual system". We present a physiologically plausible model that bridges the gap between scalp-level wave patterns to mean-field activity at the laminar level in the cortex. In addition to explaining previously published EEG results, our model makes key predictions to be tested in future experiments. Check it out <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.15.623743v1.full.pdf">here</a>. <br>

<br> 

### 19th of October 2023 - CuttingEEG talk in Lyon
It was a great pleasure to join the <a href="https://cuttinggardens2023.org/">Cutting EEG garden</a> in Lyon for a nice workshop on Neural Communication, organized by Mathilde Bonnefond, with Matteo di Volo and Julien Vezoli as speakers. Beside the interesting scientific interactions, it was very inspiring to be part of one of the first distributed conference ever, alternating online events with 'live' ones. Minimizing CO2 emissions while connecting with the local community has never been easier! 
<br> 

### 24-27th of August 2023 - CCN2023 conference in Oxford
It was great to attend our regular, annual meeting at <a href="https://2023.ccneuro.org/index.php">CCN</a> in Oxford this year! Beside presenting <a href="https://2023.ccneuro.org/proceedings/0000414.pdf">our work</a> with Martin Giurfa's team about modeling honeybee learning in trace conditioning, I was particularly glad to join the diversity lunch, and the workshop on climate action. It's great that a conference dedicates some time for these topics, and it feels good to share and discuss these issues with other fellows in the community. Kudos and gratitudes to the <a href="https://2023.ccneuro.org/organizers.php">organizers</a> for putting all of this together! <br>

### May 2023 - A Traveling Waves Perspective on Temporal Binding
An interesting commentary in <ins>Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience</ins> written with Rufin, where we explore how traveling waves may be involved in Temporal Binding. More broadly, we had fun envisioning different scenarios, disentangling travelling and standing waves, and cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical interactions in the generation of travelling waves. <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/jocn/article-abstract/doi/10.1162/jocn_a_02004/115974/A-Traveling-Waves-Perspective-on-Temporal-Binding">Here</a> the paper. <br>
<br> 

### Febrary 2023 - Distinct roles of forward and backward alpha-band waves in spatial visual attention
New paper in <ins>eLife</ins>, where we explore how traveling waves are modulated by visual selective attention. Analysing three different datasets, we were able to disentangle alpha-band top-down and bottom-up traveling waves, demonstrating that they are possibly involved in different mechanisms. <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85035">Here</a> the paper, with the precious help of Malo and Lucie, and the collaboration of Rufin VanRullen. <br>
<br> 

### Novemeber 2022 - ERC-Starting Grant OSCI-PRED funded! 
We are thrilled to announce that the OSCI-PRED project was funded for around 1.4 milion euro by the European Research Council! The projet will officially begin on March 2023 for 5 years. <br> 
You can find more information about the project <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101075930/">here</a>  <br>
<br> 

### October 2022 - On the role of feedback in image recognition under noise and adversarial attacks: A predictive coding perspective
New paper in <ins>Neural Networks</ins>, where we investigated the role of the feedback in deep neural networks using a Predictive Coding implementation. Building on our previous work (using the library 'Predify', published at NeurIPS 2021, check it out <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/75c58d36157505a600e0695ed0b3a22d-Abstract.html">here</a>), we show how the hyperparameters controling the amount of feedback varies as a function of the noise in the image. We believe these results will be of interest for both Computer Scientists and Neuroscientists. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608022004166">Here</a> the paper, in collaboration with Milad Mozafari, Bhavin Choksi and Rufin VanRullen. <br>
