Below some news about the team! <br> 

### 29th of June 2023 - IOP conference in Geneva
Presentation of our <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85035">latest work</a> on alpha waves and attention at the <a href="https://iop2023.com/">International Organization of Psychophysiology (IOP)</a>. It was great to be part of the Symposium on 'The role of ALpha Rhythm in Perception, Attention and Vigilance' with Prof. Alberto Zani, Susanna Lopez, David Pascucci and Niko Busch. <br> 
<br> 

### 22nd of May 2023 - Presentation at Pint of Science
Andrea presented (in French!!) some of the team's work about the connection between Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence. The main idea was to show how the two fields can benefit from each other. Big thank to the <a href="https://blog.incognu.fr/">Association Incognu</a> for the great organization! <br>

### May 2023 - A Traveling Waves Perspective on Temporal Binding
An interesting commentary in <ins>Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience</ins> written with Rufin, where we explore how traveling waves may be involved in Temporal Binding. More broadly, we had fun envisioning different scenarios, disentangling travelling and standing waves, and cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical interactions in the generation of travelling waves. <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/jocn/article-abstract/doi/10.1162/jocn_a_02004/115974/A-Traveling-Waves-Perspective-on-Temporal-Binding">Here</a> the paper. <br>
<br> 

### Febrary 2023 - Distinct roles of forward and backward alpha-band waves in spatial visual attention
New paper in <ins>eLife</ins>, where we explore how traveling waves are modulated by visual selective attention. Analysing three different datasets, we were able to disentangle alpha-band top-down and bottom-up traveling waves, demonstrating that they are possibly involved in different mechanisms. <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85035">Here</a> the paper, with the precious help of Malo and Lucie, and the collaboration of Rufin VanRullen. <br>

### Novemeber 2022 - ERC-Starting Grant OSCI-PRED funded! 
We are thrilled to announce that the OSCI-PRED project was funded for around 1.4 milion euro by the European Research Council! The projet will officially begin on March 2023 for 5 years. <br> 
You can find more information about the project <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101075930/">here</a>  <br>

### October 2022 - On the role of feedback in image recognition under noise and adversarial attacks: A predictive coding perspective
New paper in <ins>Neural Networks</ins>, where we investigated the role of the feedback in deep neural networks using a Predictive Coding implementation. Building on our previous work (using the library 'Predify', published at NeurIPS 2021, check it out <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/75c58d36157505a600e0695ed0b3a22d-Abstract.html">here</a>), we show how the hyperparameters controling the amount of feedback varies as a function of the noise in the image. We believe these results will be of interest for both Computer Scientists and Neuroscientists. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608022004166">Here</a> the paper, in collaboration with Milad Mozafari, Bhavin Choksi and Rufin VanRullen. <br>
