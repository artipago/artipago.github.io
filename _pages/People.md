Interested in understanding whether Bayesian inference and Predictive Coding could tell us all the secrets of the brain. For more information about my past experiences, [here](/CV.md) my CV.   <br>

<img style="float: left;" src="/assets/images/leslieResized.jpg" alt="People">  **Leslie Marie-Louise**, <ins>Project Manager</ins>.
I have a background in neuroscience and neuropsychology. I worked as a research assistant at the babylab of the École normale supérieure in Paris. I have always been fascinated by how the brain works. The neural system, human behavior and child development are my main interests. I would like to participate in the application of scientific knowledge in society and make it more accessible to all. In my free time, I enjoy dancing and traveling. I always enjoy new adventures, as long as they are as far away from spiders, ants and all the bugs as possible. I am a big fan of cake day!! | <br>

<img style="float: left;" src="/assets/images/Xiaoqi-XU resized.png" alt="People">  **Xiaoqi Xu**, <ins>PostDoc</ins>. I am a post-doc working on computational models to explain the functional role of travelling waves from a Predictive Coding point of view. My PhD work at ISAE SUPAERO focused on using mathematical approaches to decode mental states from EEG signals in the context of brain-computer interfaces. Before that I studied pure mathematics at Université Paris-Saclay and artificial intelligence at Ecole normale supérieure Paris-Saclay. <br>

<img style="float: left;" src="/assets/images/BhavinResized.jpg" alt="People">  **Bhavin Choksi**, <ins>PostDoc</ins>. I am interested in understanding networks using a special pair of glasses: one which has a machine learning lens on one and neuroscience on the other. Specifically, I am interested in building networks that are more biological and in turn using them and their properties to get a peek into the human brain.  In my free time, I am just trying to wrap my head around the fact that cheese can also be eaten as a dessert. | <br>
